This course will give an idea to the graduating student about t he \\nway of develop or engineer, software or system.  In this particular course student has to use his/her all \\nearned knowledge and experiences, to make this course interesting and successful.  Software \\nengineering is mainly concerned with real life, long-term, large-scale programming projects. This course \\nintroduces the topic through class lectures, experiences, examples, real practices and will give you an \\nopportunity to learn, practice and participate in the analysis, design and management of any size \\nsoftware or IT project. \\n \\nIn this particular course we will see how actually a software organization work, what are their functions, \\nhow they manage their projects, how they estimate and many more interesting topics.  Basically for the \\nSoftware Engineer we take the help of different tools like CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering), \\nor UML (Unified Modeling Language), but here mostly we do work by ourselves in pen & paper \\n \\nLearning Outcomes \\n \\n1. After completing the course successfully, a student can easily work in the software organization. \\n2. A student can properly develop any software by following the different models discussed in the \\ncourse. \\n3. A student can able to work in a team, can lead the software team.  \\n4. S/He can be fitted in any position of development of the software in the organization.  \\n5. Starting from the customer communication, planning, analysis to coding and testing can be \\nperfectly done by each individual.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2017-10-08T22:16:43+06:00', 'title': 'SOUTHEAST UNIVERSITY', 'author': 'Monirul Hasan', 'moddate': '2017-10-08T22:16:43+06:00', 'source': 'CourseOutline.pdf', 'total_pages': 4, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='Fall 2017 CSE 3035- Information System Design & Software Engineering Course Outline \\nPage 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n*Learn For Yourself * by: AKM Ahsanul Hoque  \\nCourse Contents \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSuggested Readings \\n \\nTextbook:  \\n1. “Software Engineering” A Practitioner’s Approach 7th, by Roger.

All students are required to join the \\ngroup. Notices about classes, make ups, assignments will be posted on the group. Exams or \\nassignments scores will be posted there, as well. \\n\\uf0b7 Academic honesty is of prime concern. Any sign of cheating in any exam/assignment \\nwill be very harshly dealt with. All students involved in such acts will receive zero score \\nfor that particular assessment. Depending on the severity of the act, further penalizing \\nactions may be taken. \\n\\uf0b7 Students can come in or leave anytime during the class. They do not need to take \\npermission from the instructor before coming or leaving. However, once the attendance \\ncall is done no edits will be done to that day's records. The idea is to promote mature \\nand responsible behavior, students aren't supposed to interrupt the flow of the class by \\nasking permission to leave. \\n\\uf0b7 We are conducting the classes in computer lab to facilitate a hands on experience of the \\nsoftware tools. If students misuse this opportunity by wasting time browsing facebook \\nor any other site that's not related to the course, they will lose 5 marks every time they \\nare spotted.\")]\n"
